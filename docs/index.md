## What is SynthFlow?

SynthFlow is designed to bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution. It features a clean, readable syntax optimized for both human developers and AI assistants.

### Key Features

*   **AI-First Design**: Syntax patterns optimized for LLM generation and understanding.
*   **Modern Tooling**: Built-in LSP server for VS Code intellisense.
*   **Clean Syntax**: Familiar control structures (`if`, `while`, `for`) with zero boilerplate.

## Quick Start

```synthflow
fn main() {
    let name = "World";
    print("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
